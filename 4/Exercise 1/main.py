# Exercise 1 Rectangle Area Calc

length = float(input("Enter the length: "))
Width = float(input("Enter the width: "))

area = length * Width

print(f"The area is: {area}cm^2")

# Before changing the data type to integr type it would throw an error
# Because you can't do arithmetic with strings properly.
